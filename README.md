Daily Reflections

Day 1: [12/11/23]
Today's Progress
Came up with an idea and plan.
Challenges will be remembering and researching how to write the code I need for what I want to do.  Blockers are the same.

Day 2: [12/12/23]
I am changing my project from Phoenix Ministries to Phoenix Transportation because it will be easier for me to come up with JavaScript code that does not involve a numbers game.
I ran into an issue with my form. I had to research a way to multiply by 0.65. ChatGPT showed me how to do it correctly.

Day 3: [12/13/23]
Today I will start by changing the mileage charge to $1.95.  Then I will start styling the pages.
Styling........I am having issues with a couple pictures going full screen instead of small picture repeated. I have requested help. I need to do my text and style it as well.

Day 4: [12/14/23]
I need to add content to my project as soon as I can get the repository on to this computer.  

Day 5: [Date]
Repeat the same structure as Day 1
