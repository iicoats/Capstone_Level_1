Daily Reflections

Day 1: [12/11/23]
Today's Progress
Came up with an idea and plan.
Challenges will be remembering and researching how to write the code I need for what I want to do. Blockers are the same.

Day 2: [12/12/23]
I am changing my project from Phoenix Ministries to Phoenix Transportation because it will be easier for me to come up with JavaScript code that does not involve a numbers game.
I ran into an issue with my form. I had to research a way to multiply by 0.65. ChatGPT showed me how to do it correctly.

Day 3: [12/13/23]
Today I will start by changing the mileage charge to $1.95. Then I will start styling the pages.
Styling........I am having issues with a couple pictures going full screen instead of small picture repeated. I have requested help. I need to do my text and style it as well.

Day 4: [12/14/23]
I need to add content to my project as soon as I can get the repository on to this computer. Cloned repo to this machine. Added some text. Adding an extension to VScode so I can go live.

Day 5: [12/15/23]
Downloaded an extintion for golive so I can check on my page. Will be adding and styling text today.
Added some content; broke buttons on home page, will ask for help in class.
Working on content and styling during class. Asked Lewis for help with what I did earlier today. I cleaned up some styling. In the process, my scrolling text on index page broke. Tomorrow I am going to work on adding a card and come up with some more content for site.

Day 6: [12/16/23]
added cards with text and photo to index and page2, worked on styling.

Final Reflection

This project was tough. I have been struggling but do feel that I am understanding a little more everyday. Styling is the hardest for me. With all of the options, I fall down the rabbit hole researching. I was able to contain myself and find what I needed.

Open-source libraries used
I am using MDN, Bootstrap, W3schools and google to figure out how to do what I want to do. I have also used Bard, ChatGpt and W3resource, SheCodes
Lewis and Brian (instructor and TA) gave me a lot of great input
